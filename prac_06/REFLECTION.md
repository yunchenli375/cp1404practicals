# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have to turn to Python documentation more, rather than simply using course videos to finish practicals.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Review the course video thoroughly before start to do the practicals.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Writing f-strings.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Using anti-pattern.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

The rigid adherence to specific patterns hinders flexibility.
Most requirements should be presented as guidelines, instead of rules.
Arbitrarily emphasizing principles (DRY, SRP) over specific application circumstances is impractical.
Sometimes the "clean" pattern is inefficient. Take the if-elif-else pattern as an example,
in worst cases, the program will execute n-1 condition expressions given n branches,
while the optimal number of executed condition expressions is log n.
