# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Not very precise, because I take the time reading the tasks into account.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

The estimation accuracy has been changing randomly.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

You cannot accurately estimate the cost of a task based on its title.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Others always has different approaches to solve the same problem.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

It is not easy to accept other's points of views,
especially when you have your own answer already.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 5 code review request](https://github.com/yufei-leo/cp1404practical/pull/1)

### Explanation

I examined multiple files to provide a comprehensive assessment, and I accurately pointed out the repetitive logic, naming problems and documentation absence. Not only did I acknowledge specific issues, but also provided actionable suggestions and format examples. The language I used is objective and focused on improvement instead of criticism, encouraging positive actions.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 08 feedback](https://github.com/Yuanbo111/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

I gave clear scope definition which explicitly states which practicals are being reviewed and which are excluded. I pointed to the exact file names and provided numbered, actionable suggestions. Firstly, I suggested more descriptive constant names. Secondly, I identified code duplication and suggested enforcement of DRY principle. Moreover, I also mentioned referential materials.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Reduce the proportion of string formatting and input validation in tasks.
More than half of the effort in completing practical tasks is consumed by reading,
comprehending, and organizing the output format, which prioritizes trivial details over essential goals.

The coding style guide is rigid and may lead to redundancy,
which is exactly what must be avoided in programming patterns.
Over-commenting creates maintenance burden, and well-named functions or variables are self-documented in obvious context.
Disallowing abbreviations is overly prescriptive and too absolute, many examples exist:

- `html` vs `hyper_text_markup_language`
- `css` vs `cascading_style_sheets`
- `url` vs `uniform_resource_locator`
- `max` vs `maximum`
- `min` vs `minimum`
- `id` vs `identifier`
- `laser` vs `light_amplification_by_stimulated_emission_of_radiation`
- `price_per_km` vs `price_per_kilometers`
- `attrgetter` vs `attribute_getter`

If the aim is to briefly introduce the GUI programming,
tkinter bounded with python language is enough, and also make the tutorial simpler.
(without installing 3rd-package or PyCharm extensions or learning kivy sub-language)

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Code formatting.
